Usage: %s [-p port] [-P forward_port] [-d delay] [-j jitter]\n"
"       %*s [-e err_rate] [-c cut_rate] [-l loss_rate] [-s seed] [-h]\n"
"-p port          The UDP port on which the link simulator operates.\n"
"                 Defaults to: 1341\n"
"-P forward_port  The UDP port on localhost on which the incoming traffic\n"
"                 should be forwarded.\n"
"                 Defaults to: 12345\n"
"-d delay         The delay (in ms) that should be applied to the traffic.\n"
"                 Defaults to: 0\n"
"-j jitter        The jitter (in ms) that should be applied to the traffic.\n"
"                 The total delay applied to one packet will be:\n"
"                 delay + rand[-jitter, jitter].\n"
"                 Defaults to: 0\n"
"                 Unused if delay == 0.\n"
"-e err_rate      The rate of packet corruption occurrence (in packet/100).\n"
"                 Defaults to: 0\n"
"                 A packet that has been corrupted will NOT be cut.\n"
"-c cut_rate      The rate of packet being cut after the header to simulate\n"
"                 router truncation due to high network load (in packet/100).\n"
"                 Defaults to: 0\n"
"                 A packet that has been cut will NOT be corrupted.\n"
"-l loss_rate     The rate of packets loss (in packet/100).\n"
"                 Defaults to 0\n"
"-s seed          The seed for the random generator, to replay a previous\n"
"                 session.\n"
"                 Defaults to: time() casted to int\n"
"-r               Simulate the link on the reverse path.\n"
"-R               Simulate the link in both ways.\n"
"-h               Prints this message and exit.\n"
